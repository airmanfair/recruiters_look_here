## **Instructions to recruiters and potential employers:**

Each of the images within this public repo is a preview of one of the projects I did during my time at UC Berkeley or for the research I took part in post graduation. If you are interested in the code and file structure of one of the aforementioned projects, the filepath to reach that information is located near the bottom of each preview. 

I am required to keep the projects I completed throughout college along with the research I have done so far in a private repo due to campus policies, so you will need to request access to view them. There are two private repos you would be interested in: *school_projects* and *research_projects*. If you see a filepath in a preview that starts with either of these directory names, see below regarding how to request access.

There are many other projects and assignments within these repos, I only chose to create previews for some of the more interesting work I have done over the last few years. After you have have been given access to a private repo, feel free to go through anything you like.

I have uploaded a text document within this repo that provides the full names of the courses I took to ease the process of browsing through the directory (it is organized by course number, i.e. CS189 --> Introduction to Machine Learning).

## **To request access:**

Please reach out to me via email or LinkedIn with your Github username and the name of the drive(s) you would like to request access to (*school_projects* or *research_projects*). If it is during normal business hours, I should be able to get back to you within an hour or so. Outside of business hours I should be able to get back to you the same day, though response times will vary.
